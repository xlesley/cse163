# CSE163 Final Project

## Here is where we get the dataset
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

- You should write instructions for us to run your project to reproduce your results. Tell us which Python modules to run to get your results and anything else we need to do to run them.
- If there is anything we need to do to set up your project, like install libraries or how to download your data (if you did not submit it), give us instructions for how to do so.
- Anything else we need to know about running your project!
